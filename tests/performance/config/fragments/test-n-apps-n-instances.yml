# ----------------------------------------------------------- #
# Configuration Fragment : N apps / N instances scale test    #
# ----------------------------------------------------------- #
# This fragment defines two parameters that we are going to   #
# explore: the number of `aps` and the number of `instances`. #
#                                                             #
# It also defines how these parameters are going to be a      #
# applied to the marathon instance.                           #
#                                                             #
# Finally, it also includes an inter-test clean-up phase that #
# helps reduce the number of resources consumed by the test.  #
